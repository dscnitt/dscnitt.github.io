## Contributing
This is an open source software project and I encourage developers to contribute patches and code for us to include in the main website of DSC NIT Trichy. All contributions will be fully credited.

## Using GitHub Issues
* Feel free to use GitHub issues for questions, bug reports, and feature requests
* Use the search feature to check for an existing issue
* Include as much information as possible and provide any relevant resources (Eg. screenshots)
* For bug reports ensure you have a reproducible test case
    * A pull request with a breaking test would be super preferable here but isn't required
